# Tic-Tac-Toe
The classic game configured for online play. 
4-5 generations of HTML, middle div having 2-3 unto itself. Border-radius for grid display? CSS grid?
id for each grid square that may be equipped with an EV, possibly delegate from parent div?  .map()? For loop? 
Need some way to know which square is free/occupied
If use array for grid, [0-8] can programmatically determine win array combos 
Each event fires a few different logical operators
Data model consists of wins, squares, turns, plays
SRP!
Game object: playerTurn property with a boolean?
Don't need id for every box, but will need a container holding nine distinct locations
