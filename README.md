# Tic Tac Toe
The classic game rendered in a beautiful rendition of fire vs water! Users play against a CPU after selecting their player.

## Features
- Player Selection :
Users may select their player, Master of Water or Master of Fire, and battle against a CPU opponent.
- CPU Opponent:
While it is a two player game, only one player may wage battle against a CPU opponent capable of making moves on the board.
- Win Tally:
When a game has been completed, a winner is declared, the board is reset, and the loser gets the next turn.
- Draw
What if there's a draw? The game declares a draw, and the winner's turn is set next.
